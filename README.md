# Reddit Sentiment Analysis Bot
 Developed a Python script that performs sentiment analysis on the top posts of a specified subreddit using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool. Utilized the Reddit API and OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure access to Reddit data.

To use, run the script in your terminal and follow the printed directions, entering your desired subreddit.
